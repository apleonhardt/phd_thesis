\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
\label{chp:ack}



Many have accompanied me on this scientific journey. In no particular order, I thank
Armin Bahl for teaching me how to tackle a problem,
Franz Weber for a spirited introduction to what unfortunately remained theoretical electrophysiology,
Hubert Eichner for spotting non-answers from a great distance,
Georg Ammer for knowing everything I don't and not expecting much in return,
Michael Drews for showing me how to immerse yourself in science,
Florian Richter for his mastery of Bash,
Anna Schützenberger for shaking her head when it mattered most,
Sandra Fendl for moral guidance,
Isabella Kauer for steering me back toward music,
Alexander Arenz for his enthusiasm in all things science,
Alex Mauss for being on top of things,
Jürgen Haag for having been on top of things since before I was born,
Stefan Prech for nifty ideas and his knack for turning them into nifty tools,
Ruben Portugues and Stefan Glasauer for joining and enriching a belated advisory committee,
Romina Kutlesa and Christian Theile for their support with experiments,
everyone in our group for making it a little bubble of joy both scientific and not,
everyone at the Max-Planck-Institute for making it a place worth missing,
and Matthias Meier and Etienne Serbe for things so numerous I can't hope to write them down.

Alexander, Alex, and Matthias kindly read and greatly improved this thesis.

For supporting me throughout these years, I am grateful to my family and all friends not named so far. Finally, I thank Emilia Geiger for everything; without her, these pages would be empty.
