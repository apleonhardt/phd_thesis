\section{Normative views of sensory neuroscience}

A core tenet of evolutionary theory is the idea that animals are in some sense adapted to their particular niche \citep{Darwin:1859aa}. This notion naturally extends to brains and specifically sensory systems. Ecological environments are not arbitrary; they exhibit statistical structure. The laws of physics, for instance, impose a level of regularity onto the set of possible sensory stimuli. Some such stimuli are more probable than others while certain configurations are outright incompatible with the rules that govern any given organism's surroundings.

It is a reasonable supposition that nervous systems strive to determine the veridical state of the world based on noisy sensory data, insofar as it supports a given behavioral program. \textit{A priori} assumptions about the way the world tends to be should then make this process more efficient and reliable. This approach to sensory systems enjoys a rich history, going back to Helmholtz who framed perception as the probabilistic problem of "unconscious inference" \citep{Helmholtz:1867aa}. It is closely connected to Bayesian theories of sensing but operates on much longer, evolutionary time scales \citep{Doya:2007aa}.

The evolutionary or teleological perspective is inherently normative. From a combination of purpose and environment, one can derive predictions about what properties the system ought to have if it is to fulfill its purpose effectively and efficiently. These predictions can then be tested experimentally. As such, it complements the purely descriptivist perspective on neural perceptual machinery which heavily relies on simplified, tractable inputs. A central theme of my dissertation is the question to what extent natural visual statistics are reflected in the properties of neural circuitry, using fly motion vision as a model system. The following section provides some relevant background.

\subsection{Statistics of natural visual scenes} Understanding the natural stimulus distribution is fundamental to normative approaches in sensory neuroscience. Given the topic at hand, this section focuses on natural visual stimuli. Whether captured by eye or camera, natural images exhibit clear regularities that set them apart from uniformly distributed noise. Realistic images thus represent only a small subset of all possible pixel configurations.

This is easily visualized by manipulating pictures in Fourier space \citep{Hyvarinen:2009hf}. Unaltered images exhibit edges, gradients, homogeneous textures, and segregated objects. These typical features also extend to natural video sequences. Randomizing the phase structure of images scrambles their higher-order structure and yields phenomenologically atypical textures, even though the manipulation conserves second-order statistics as a consequence of the natural amplitude spectrum. Nonetheless, local patches may well resemble real image features. Finally, when one flattens the image's frequency spectrum, unambiguously artificial noise remains. Critically, at each stage we can clearly distinguish between images that fall within or outside the distribution of natural visual scenes.

% FIGURE!!!

Large corpora of calibrated natural scene images like the ones generated by \citet{vanHateren:1998jt} or \citet{Tkacik:2011aa} make it possible to characterize fundamental statistical properties. Below, I describe a subset of relevant features, ranging from first-order parameters to more complex traits.

\subsubsection{Luminance}

As a first step, one can measure the distribution of pixel luminance. After per-image normalization, linearly scaled luminance values in natural images are typically positively skewed \citep{Brady:2000aa,Laughlin:1981wn,Geisler:2008gu}. That is, pixels that are dark relative to average luminance numerically outweigh bright ones. When put on a logarithmic scale, this results in a symmetric distribution. The finding applies universally to image sets across a multitude of environments. Presumably, the skewness follows from basic physical principles.

\subsubsection{Contrast}
Another fundamental statistic is local contrast. Its quantification is less straightforward than in the case of luminance as it requires assumptions about the sensory system and the stimulus under investigation. Common definitions are the difference between feature and background luminance divided by the latter (so-called Weber contrast), the standard deviation of normalized luminance in a small image patch (so-called root-mean-squared contrast), or the difference of luminance extrema normalized by their sum (so-called Michelson contrast, often applied to wide-field stimuli).

Alternatively, in analogy to processing in retinal ganglion cells, contrast can be modeled as the response of divisively normalized center-surround receptive fields. Here, a similar asymmetry as for luminance emerges: At all spatial scales, natural images contain more dark (OFF) than light (ON) contrast \citep{Ratliff:2010kb,Cooper:2015in}. This is a direct consequence of the positively skewed luminance distribution. Luminance and contrast are not fully independent: their correlation is small but clearly negative \citep{Geisler:2008gu}.

\subsubsection{Spatial patterns}
Spatial structure represents one of the most informative aspects of any scene. A hallmark of natural images is the shape of their Fourier amplitude spectra \citep{Geisler:2008gu}. The average contribution of component frequencies falls with frequency and is well modeled by the function $1/f^n$ with $n\approx1.0$ \citep{Ruderman:1994ty,Field:1987ua,Dyakova:2015dy}. As a consequence, natural images are approximately scale-invariant; zooming in or out does not substantially affect the shape of the Fourier spectrum. Interestingly, the pink noise model also reproduces spatial properties of local patches in naturalistic video sequences \citep{Dong:1995aa} even though the complex statistics of animal movement make the task of gathering ecologically relevant stimuli difficult.

As discussed above, pink Gaussian (or $1/f$) noise serves as a reasonable local approximation to realistic images but falls short in several ways. One of them is a linearly symmetric luminance distribution which does not reproduce natural skew \citep{Geisler:2008gu}. Moreover, it fails to model the heavy-tailed response properties of arbitrary receptive fields scanning natural scenes \citep{Field:1987ua}. Clearly, the Fourier spectrum does not provide an exhaustive description of real-world spatial features. Natural images show pronounced co-linearity, parallel contours, sharp transitions, and many other forms of spatial regularity that go beyond simplistic second-order features.

\subsubsection{Other features}
In addition to the most salient subset of features outlined above, researchers have mapped the natural statistics of many additional image properties. They include depth \citep{Huang:2000aa}, color \citep{Ruderman:1998aa,Wachtler:2001aa}, and optic flow \citep{Roth:2005aa,Roth:2007bg}, but are often limited in throughput by the available measurement devices and sensors \citep{Geisler:2008gu}. Reliable estimation of natural statistics in high-dimensional spaces requires sufficient volumes of data. For this reason, static but large image databases have been an important foundation for research in the space \citep{vanHateren:1998jt}.

\subsubsection{Visual ecology}
To relate any visual system to naturally occurring stimuli, a reasonable approximation of the neuro-ecologically relevant image distribution is required. Available natural scene libraries are biased toward human visual surrounds when it comes to choice of environment, perspective, focal length, resolution, and other parameters \citep{Tkacik:2011aa}. Many of these qualities are at odds with the experience of a typical fruit fly. For instance, the \textit{Drosophila} eye processes scenes at the comparatively low resolution of approximately $25 \times 25$ facets or "pixels", covering almost $180\degree$ of azimuth at a separation of $\approx5\degree$ \citep{Borst:2009gv}. The spatial acuity of the fly eye is thus orders of magnitude below that of its human counterpart. Moreover, not much is known about the ground-truth visual statistics of the environment in which \textit{Drosophila} initially evolved \citep{Dickinson:2014aa}.

%Not a problem because scale invariance.
Spatial differences between typical inputs, however, are attenuated by the aforementioned invariance of realistic image amplitude spectra. Generally, drosophilids are extremely widespread and resilient organisms. Their brains possess comparatively few neurons, resulting in limited degrees of freedom. As a consequence, visual adaptation is unlikely to be deeply environment-specific \citep{Dickinson:2014aa}. Finally, many of the lower-order statistics discussed above appear to be due to fundamental properties of the world and therefore generalize to visual environments across the board \citep{Geisler:2008gu,Simoncelli:2001dn}. \citet{vanHateren:1997vg}, for instance, studied fly retinal processing but gathered natural visual time series data simply by walking through a forest while recording the output of a LED attached at human eye level.

\subsection{Information theory}

% CHECK WHAT YOU CAN CITE FROM THE 2000s

Information theory, a branch of probability theory initially developed in the context of engineered communication channels \citep{Cover:2006aa,Shannon:1948aa}, provides a powerful technique for studying neural and particularly sensory processing \citep{Borst:1999hw}.

The activity of visual sensory neurons is generally related to some parameter of a given stimulus. In the case of motion-selective units, this could include direction, velocity, or acceleration. Classically, experiments probe possible relationships by systematically varying parameters and recording stimulus-response curves to determine what feature of the visual input is encoded. When considering the function of neural circuits, however, precision of encoding also matters: we want to quantify rigorously not just what but also how much stimulus-related information a sensory cell carries. Information theory offers a principled way of studying relationships of this type by measuring the reduction in uncertainty about the stimulus any given signal provides.

Formally, this is achieved by determining the entropy of a conditional probability distribution and closely related to ideal-observer models of decoding. Consider a simple experiment in which the responses of a direction-selective neurons are measured as a function of a specific stimulus feature like pattern velocity. The information about a certain stimulus condition $s_x$ provided by the neuron's response $R$ is then calculated as
\begin{equation}
    I(R, s_x) = \sum_{i} p(r_i | s_x) \log_2 \frac{p(r_i | s_x)}{p(r_i)}
\end{equation}
where $i$ indexes the set of all enumerated responses, $p(r_i)$ denotes the marginal probability of a specific response across all stimulus conditions, and $p(r_i | s_x)$ denotes the response probability conditioned on a specific stimulus \citep{Borst:1999hw}. $I$ is positive and, for $\log_2$, measured in bits. This quantity is equivalent to the mutual information between response and a specific stimulus \citep{Cover:2006aa}. Intuitively, it rigorously measures how much an ideal observer could learn about the stimulus from the neuron's response.

Average information is computed as the probability-weighted sum of specific per-stimulus information
\begin{equation}
    I(R, S) = \sum_{j} p(s_j) I(R, s_j)
\end{equation}
which is equal to the mean in stimulus-balanced designs. Note that information as defined here critically depends on experimental decisions like response binning and the choice of stimulus conditions. Values hinge on the choice of alphabet used to represent the experiment.

For some designs, one can derive theoretical bounds on the transmission capacity of neural channels and estimate normative qualities like the efficiency of a neural code by weighing transmitted information against maximally possible response entropy. It naturally extends to the encoding of dynamic stimuli. Such probabilistic methods work even in the absence of a specific response model and without making strong assumptions about the function of a sensory system or the constraints under which it operates.

The technique has been used to quantify coding efficiency and determine transmission bounds for several model systems including motion-sensitive neurons in flies \citep{Bialek:1991aa,vanSteveninck:1997aa,Haag:1998wr}, electroreceptors in fish \citep{Wessel:1996aa}, and retinal ganglion cells in the salamander \citep{Warland:1997aa}. Critically, measured information rates depend on the choice of stimulus ensemble. In frog auditory neurons, for instance, \citet{Rieke:1995aa} found efficiency values close to 90\% when they tested naturalistic input.

\subsection{Efficient coding}
Sensory systems evolve under a multitude of constraints \citep{Sterling:2015aa}. One of them is the need to detect stimuli that are survival-critical. Another is the need to perform this task using a minimum of metabolic energy. A third comes from the natural distribution of environmental features. The \textit{efficient coding hypothesis}, going back to \citet{Attneave:1954aa}, \citet{Barlow:1961aa}, and others, formalizes this approach to understanding biological sensors. Their theory was heavily influenced by the development of information theory which made a rigorous quantification of notions like channel capacity or redundancy feasible \citep{Cover:2006aa,Borst:1999hw}.

Efficient coding assumes that the goal of a sensory system is to represent as much relevant information as possible using the smallest feasible amount of resources. Selecting appropriate objective functions is, of course, fraught with difficulty. Ground truth constraints are generally not available and sensory organs often support a broad range of behavioral functions, each of which may necessitate a different definition of relevance. Nonetheless, the theory has successfully predicted features of real systems by assuming basic, tractable goals. In the sensory periphery, this usually takes the form of general preservation of information, thus maximizing the number of possible downstream use cases.

The main target of early vision then becomes reduction of redundancy. Ideally, signals carried by peripheral sensory neurons should be statistically independent in order to minimize wasteful duplication of information. Natural images exhibit regular statistics such as characteristically shaped power spectra that give rise to specific correlation structures. By removing such correlations and emphasizing deviations from expected natural statistics, an operation commonly termed whitening, early vision minimizes energy expenditure while conserving features of the stimulus that are presumed to be behaviorally relevant.

The fly retina provides classical demonstrations of this principle at work. \citet{Laughlin:1981wn} measured naturally occurring luminance distributions and compared the resulting histograms to corresponding response functions of lamina bipolar cells which form the first processing stage after the light-sensitive photoreceptor. In line with predictions from efficient coding, these response functions effectively equalized the histograms, making all outputs equally likely under the assumption of a natural stimulus distribution. A related study \citep{Srinivasan:1982uq} could show that lateral inhibition in the fly retina reliably removes the long-range correlations typical for natural images, effectively suppressing background, retaining sensitivity to small fluctuations, and implementing a type of predictive coding.

Constraint triples of this type---minimization of resources, maximization of transmitted information, assuming some naturalistic stimulus distribution---have been equally fruitfully applied to early processing in retina and visual cortex of mammals. Center-surround receptive fields in both retina and lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the cat have been suggested to implement spatial filters that are well suited to whitening the typical power spectra of natural images \citep{vanHateren:1992aa,vanHateren:1993aa,Atick:1992aa}. \citet{Dan:1996aa} confirmed this prediction experimentally by recording LGN responses to natural movies, finding them to be largely statistically independent. \citet{Ratliff:2010kb} argue that the asymmetry in ON and OFF contrast prevalence mentioned above explain the difference in numbers between ON and OFF retinal ganglion cells in the vertebrate retina. Interestingly, evidence from primary sensory neurons in V1 of awake mice indicates that adaptation to natural scene statistics partially depends on experience; if raised in stimulus-deprived environments, predictive coding of specifically real images is abolished \citep{Pecka:2014aa}.

A closely related normative doctrine is that of sparse and distributed coding: the idea that sensory systems like visual cortex aim to represent natural stimuli using a minimum of active neurons \citep{Simoncelli:2001dn}. \citet{Ohlshausen:1996aa}, for instance, optimized a linear generative model to reconstruct natural images under the constraint of activation sparseness. The resulting filters bear striking resemblance to localized oriented bandpass receptive fields in area V1, indicating that early visual cortex is adapted to the task of efficiently representing real-world stimulus distributions \citep[for a related method, based on independent component analysis, see][]{vanHateren:1998jt,Bell:1997ve}.

\subsection{Task-centric approaches}
Efficient coding theory sidesteps the question of task relevance and presupposes that peripheral sensory systems perform lossless compression while maximizing efficiency. This has been a frequent source of criticism \citep{Simoncelli:2003aa}. After all, brains solve particular problems, so not all information is equal. Relevance may well depend on the particular nature of downstream processing or even behavioral state. For this reason alone, efficient coding is unlikely to scale to higher-level computation.

Instead of choosing a generic normative aim like information preservation, one may be able to do better by picking a specific, task-bound objective function. Encouraging examples come from recent advances in artificial pattern recognition \citep{Bishop:2006aa} and specifically the hierarchical models prevalent in so-called deep learning \citep{Goodfellow:2016aa}. Response properties along the visual cortical pathway go from simple local receptive fields in V1 to object-specific and invariant representations in higher areas \citep{Felleman:1991aa,Yamins:2016hg}. Such neurons are sensitive to, for instance, cars regardless of perspective. Hierarchical neural networks that mimic aspects of this organization \citep{Fukushima:1980ve} have reached human-like performance on large object recognition data sets, made possible by advances in optimization techniques \citep{LeCun:1989aa} and raw processing power \citep{LeCun:2015dt}. \citet{Yamins:2014gi} modeled an artificial deep network after the primate object recognition cascade consisting of areas V1, V2, V4, and IT. After training this system to recognize classes of objects in natural images, they compared learned weights with representations in the biological system and found striking similarities, at least in higher layers \citep{Cadieu:2014in}. More generally, early stages of visually trained deep networks often exhibit receptive fields that resemble those found in the vertebrate retina or V1 \citep{Yamins:2016hg}.

In psychophysics, studies have successfully predicted texture salience from statistical properties of natural images \citep{Tkacik:2010aa,Hermundstad:2014aa}. By determining maximally informative features in real stimuli, it was possible to predict behavioral performance for a given synthetic texture.

Task-driven approaches have also been applied to the visual system of the fly. \citet{Clark:2014aa} and \citet{Fitzgerald:2015aa} optimized a motion detector to maximize the linear correlation between time-averaged model output and true velocity of rigidly translating natural images. While functionally plausible, this makes strong assumptions about the true goal of motion-sensing elements and evolutionary pressures at work. Other studies put fly motion responses in their functional context by optimizing closed-loop course stabilization but did not take natural stimulus distribution into account \citep{Warzecha:1996bm,Warzecha:1998tn}.

Combining behaviorally relevant targets with biologically plausible models appears to be a promising tool for understanding neural processing beyond the sensory periphery. Of course, for complex and highly multiplexed information processing systems like the brain, ascribing goals remains challenging: one may well be wrong about what any given circuit is in fact trying to achieve. Additionally, the approach critically depends on the choice of model---say, a feedforward network for cortical processing as opposed to a more plausible recurrent design---and the techniques used for post-hoc comparisons between model and neural circuit \citep{Yamins:2016hg}.

\subsection{Visually guided behaviors}
Flies and specifically \textit{D. melanogaster} exhibit a largely stereotyped, well characterized repertoire of visually driven behaviors \citep{Borst:2014kl}.
% BETTER CITATION
This has greatly contributed to their ongoing popularity in the field of motion vision. Reflexive responses facilitate the precise measurement of sensory input-output relationships in large volumes. Systems neuroscience derives predictions about neural processing from quantitative descriptions of behavior which drive physiological work. In turn, behavioral tasks provide powerful high-throughput test beds for hypotheses generated from mapping neural circuits.

A vast majority of behaviors is not explored in the ecological context of freely moving animals but under strictly controlled conditions instead. Deviations from naturalness include head-fixation, tethering, artificial visual stimulation, and synthetic stimulus statistics. Experimental abstraction allows for full control of sensory stimuli and exact observation of fly movements. However, it also runs the risk of mapping artificial behavioral motifs that do not generalize to ecological settings \citep{Krakauer:2017aa}. The controlled approach and in particular the reliable optomotor response have nonetheless shed significant light on the inner workings of motion detection circuitry in flies.

Behavioral assays were a critical component of my work in the studies that comprise the thesis at hand. In the following section, I survey the range of visual reflexes with a clear focus on \textit{Drosophila}, referring to other commonly employed fly genera (like \textit{Musca} or \textit{Calliphora}) where instructive.

\subsubsection{Optomotor response}
Flies tend to follow the visual motion of their surround. When for instance tethered to the center of a rotating textured drum, they reflexively attempt to turn in the same direction. This behavioral pattern is termed optomotor response. It was first rigorously studied by \citet{Hassenstein:1956fa} who placed \textit{Chlorophanus viridis} on a spherical Y-maze that was light enough to be held and moved by the beetle, thereby simulating walking while keeping the animal fixed relative to the stimulus. They then counted leftward versus rightward choices as a function of various parameters of a motion stimulus to estimate turning tendency. Their quantitative findings formed the foundation of the algorithmic Hassenstein-Reichardt model for insect optomotor behavior \citep{Reichardt:1961aa}, which is discussed in more detail below.

The optomotor response is not exclusive to one mode of locomotion. It can be demonstrated in tethered flying \textit{Drosophila}, measured via torque meter or as the difference between wing beat frequencies, as well as in flies walking on treadmill systems \citep{Buchner:1976kd,Gotz:1964bj,Fermi:1963aa,Goetz:1973aa}. While commonly elicited by yaw motion revolving around the vertical body axis of the fly, it generalizes to pitch and roll \citep{Blondeau:1982hd}. When the fly's head is left unrestrained, its movements also track stimulus direction \citep{Hengstenberg:1988kg,Haikala:2013cm}.

A plethora of studies has mapped the properties of the optomotor response \citep[see][]{Borst:2010fk}. Critically, the behavior does not appear to be driven by true rotational velocity; many other stimulus features influence response amplitudes. The most salient findings are summarized in the following:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Flies turn in the same direction as the pattern.
    \item Responses initially grow with pattern velocity but show a clear optimum, after which turning decreases again.
    \item Stimulus geometry has a strong effect on the velocity tuning. For sine gratings, increasing the pattern wavelength $\lambda$ shifts the optimum towards larger velocities $v$. Critically, the fly optomotor response is tuned not to stimulus velocity but to contrast frequency instead, which is given by $f = \frac{v}{\lambda}$.
    \item The magnitude of the response increases with stimulus contrast.
\end{enumerate}

% FUNCTION AND OTHER SPECIES

Functionally, the reflex is usually interpreted as a compensatory mechanism. Flies perform acrobatic maneuvers whose instantaneous rotational velocity may well exceed \SI{2000}{\degree\per\second} during unrestrained flight, all at forward speeds of up to \SI{0.7}{\metre\per\second} in larger species \citep{Land:1974dp,Mronz:2008eb}. At the same time, the weight of an individual fruit fly is on the order of \SI{0.2}{\milli\gram} \citep{Seiger:1966a}. This makes them vulnerable to external perturbations like sudden gusts of wind. Internal sources of noise, like miniscule asymmetries in wing structure, may exacerbate the problem.

In concert with proprioceptive mechanisms, the optomotor response confers some protection against unintended path deviations. Any turning response that is syndirectional with global optic flow will eventually return the fly to straight heading. The optomotor response thus implements a simple visual feedback system that keeps the fly on course \citep{Borst:2014kl}. Comparable locomotor reflexes are found in other insects and fish \citep{Orger:2000cy}, and the optomotor response closely resembles the widespread optokinetic reflex that stabilizes the eye during movement.

% FIND BETTER CITATION FOR ORGER

Traditionally, optomotor responses have been studied in tethered animals. If the functional logic outlined above holds, then it should also be possible to observe a visually induced following reflex in unrestrained behavior. Counter-intuitively, \citet{Goetz:1970aa} found that groups of fruit flies placed in a rotating drum moved against the direction of the wall pattern. This was later successfully explained as a consequence of complex superpositions of external stimulus and self-induced translating optic flow \citep{Goetz:1975aa}. \citet{Strauss:1997ut} used on-line tracking and live generation of appropriate stimuli to suppress self-generated feedback and confirmed tethered turning behavior in free walking. While tracking flying flies in a large arena, \citet{Mronz:2008eb} could elicit prolonged curved trajectories and largely suppress the body saccades typical for \textit{Drosophila} flight by rotating the cylinder's texture.

\subsubsection{Landing and escape response}
Flies are notoriously capable at evading fast-moving objects and rarely collide with static landmarks. Motion sensors signal imminent collisions through particular patterns of translational optic flow. Approaching a textured surface results in visual expansion whose magnitude correlates with distance and thus, critically, time to impact \citep{Koenderink:1986um}. By selectively extracting looming flow fields, flies can trigger the appropriate response. When at rest, they initiate a fast and largely stereotyped escape. When flying, they either evade or perform the adjustments required for safe landing \citep{Borst:2014kl}.

Several studies have investigated the latter condition in tethered experimental settings. For laterally expanding square-wave gratings, \textit{Drosophila} robustly steer away from the focus of expansion \citep{Tammero:2002aa}. Centered expansion, on the other hand, activates a landing sequence. \citet{Duistermars:2007aa} systematically compared the tuning properties of expansion-triggered evasion and rotation-triggered optomotor response. The two pathways differed in pooling and contrast sensitivity, yet, aspects like temporal and spatial sensitivity were strikingly similar. This indicates that both behaviors draw from the same set of motion-sensitive units which are then processed differentially.

Centrally positioned expansion of sine or square-wave gratings prompts the landing response, which consists of a fixed sequence of postural and steering-related adjustments \citep{Braitenberg:1966aa,Goodman:1960aa,Borst:1986wx}. Critically, the delay leading up to initiation of this program depends on spatial and temporal aspects of the expanding stimulus. By manipulating these parameters, \citet{Bahde:1986eh} demonstrated that a single set of motion detecting units could feasibly underlie both optomotor and landing response in the housefly \textit{M. domestica}. Their model simply integrates motion signals up to a certain threshold after which the landing sequence is started. This system was capable of reliably predicting response latencies.

When at rest, flies respond to fast expansion by rapidly initiating a controlled jump. This happens within $\approx\SI{200}{\milli\second}$ of stimulus onset and is not completely stereotyped. In a majority of cases, flies manage to coordinate their take-off such that they escape away from the looming stimulus, which hints at a surprisingly elaborate transformation from visual input to motor output \citep{Card:2008aa}. Recent high-resolution tracking of escape responses revealed a subtly bimodal distribution of time courses, indicating two distinct, stimulus-dependent escape programs and thus even more complex behavioral phenomenology \citep{Reyn:2014aa}. Intriguingly, \citet{Muijres:2014aa} tracked the flight kinematics of looming-triggered escape responses in freely flying \textit{D. melanogaster} and observed extremely rapid banked turns consisting of carefully calibrated turns and counter-turns. This presumably survival-critical sequence is completed within a small number of wing beats, and testament to the impressive maneuverability of fruit flies.
